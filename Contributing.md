# Contributing to Inspeqtor

## Open an issue

Tell us about bugs so we can fix them, please!  Include your inspeqtor
version, OS version you are running and any relevant configuration or
log output in /var/log/inspeqtor.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests should:

 1. Come with a solid description of what you are trying to achieve.
 1. Have a reasonable amount of tests which verify the changes.
 1. Fit the existing code style and design of the project.

When in doubt, open an issue first and let's chat about what needs to be
done and how.

## Legal Stuff

One very important thing to understand about submitting a pull request
is that I must be the only copyright holder for the inspeqtor code.  **This means
you disavow any rights or claims to code you submit and assign those rights to me** (@mperham).

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (many employers do
not allow this), you should not submit a PR.  Open an issue and someone
else can do the work.
